## Conclusion

nf-core/eager is an efficient, portable, and accessible pipeline for processing
ancient genomic data. This re-implementation of EAGER into Nextflow and nf-core
will improve reproducibility and inclusion of rapidly increasing aDNA datasets,
for both large and small laboratories. Extensive documentation also enables
newcomers to the field to get a practical understanding on how to interpret aDNA
in the context of NGS data processing. Ultimately, nf-core/eager provides easier
access to the latest tools and routine screening analyses commonly used in the
field, and sets up the pipeline for remaining at the forefront of palaeogenetic
analysis.
